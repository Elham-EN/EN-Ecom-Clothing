# Key features of this E-commerce application :

  * Used Firebase to build full stack application, authentication, user accounts
  
  * Use Redux with flux design pattern to manage "global" state that is needed across many 
    part of my application and redux store serves as centralized store for whole application. 
    
    Why I used Redux ?
    
      * My application had large amounts of state that are needed in many place in the app.
      
      * The app state is updated frequently over time
      
      * The logic to update the state may gets more complex and props drill was a bad practice 
      
      * The app has a large-sized codebase and redux was needed.  
      
      
      
      
      How to be a pro react developer ? 

        1. Decide on Components 
          a. What is a components ?
          
          b. How much do we want to break down a component ?
          
          c. How do we build these reusable components ?

        2. Decide the state and where it lives 
          a. State can live in different location in our virtual DOM
          
          b. Placing state in the appropriate components
	
        3.  What changes when state changes 
          a. What changes should we make when state changes Based on what this JS object called state is changed.
          
          b. We have to decide what to render, what part of the virtual DOM changes and deciding on this is also 
             important because it has a huge effects on performance. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
